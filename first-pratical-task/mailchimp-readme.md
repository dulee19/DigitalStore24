# I created a Mailchimp email list and generated a custom signup form, which I embedded directly into my HTML page. I styled it using custom CSS to match a clean and modern design while keeping it responsive. After testing locally, the form successfully collected email addresses and displayed the built-in success message from Mailchimp.

# First - I've created an account on Mailchimp after that I've created an Audience called - Test Registration List
# Then I went to Embedded forms and there they gave me a embedded code for the form, which I pasted down below (last section).
# The form collected email address and displayed them into Audience / Contacts
