# Creative Thinking Question - https://www.digibiz24.com/en

# Imagine DigiBiz needs a new homepage hero section - What can I suggest? Here is my approach.

# For DigiBiz24 - I’d design a hero section that instantly communicates how easy it is to sell digital products online. The headline would be simple and benefit focused like for example: "Sell Your Digital Products in Minutes" with a clear CTA like "Start for Free.".
# I'd include a clean product visual or short demo video to show the product in action.
# The design would stay minimal and professional, guiding users to take action without distractions, and keep users focused, matching the site’s sleek, professional look while focusing on conversion.
